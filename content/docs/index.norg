*Welcome to the Norgolith documentation page!*

Norgolith is the monolithic {https://github.com/nvim-neorg/norg-specs}[Norg] static site generator.
Transform your Norg content into high-performance websites with /opt-in/ validation and ease!

** Key Features
   - *Norg-first workflow*: write in Norg, publish as HTML.
   - *Real-time previews*: development server with full live reload capabilities.
   - *Validation engine*: catch errors during development to avoid them from reaching your
     production site!
   -- *Content Schemas*: Opt-in metadata structure enforcement.
   - *Simple yet powerful theme system*: semver-enforced site appearances that can be installed and
     customized with ease.

** Project Philosophy
   - *Precision*: Leverage Rust's type safety and content validation.
   - *Extensibility*: Plugin-ready architecture (WIP).
   - *Community-driven*: Built with open collaboration and feedback from the community! ðŸ’œ
